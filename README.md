Here's how you can write instructions for the README.md file on how to run your SQL editor:


## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Access to Google BigQuery and Snowflake databases
- Environment variables configured for database connection details (see Environment Variables section)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-editor.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd sql-editor
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
